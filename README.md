[Link to Portfolio](hectorperez.surge.sh) - Hosted by Surge.sh, Web Publishing for Developers. 

## About
---
A static webpage, showcasing my projects and skills, built with HTML5, CSS3, and React.js framework. As I continue learning and practicing, I want to implement Bootstrap, SASS, and utilize 3rd party software, where I can recieve Emails from a "Contact Me" form.

## Future plan

I want to change the domain from surge.sh to hectorperez.tech down the line. I've already registered the domain, but I've yet to decide on a hosting provider. Please contact me if you would like to give me a good recommendation to one!!
